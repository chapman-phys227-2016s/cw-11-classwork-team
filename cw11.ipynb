    "A fourth order Runga Kutta is used to model a sombrero potential subjected to both drag and a harmonic shaking motion. A ball in the sombrero potential has potential energy described by $V(x) = x^4/4 - x^2/2$. Taking the negative spacial derivative of this potential gives us the force from the sombrero as $f_{\\text{hat}}(x) = -V'(x) = -x^3 + x$. To provide for a more realistic ball trajectory, we include a drag force of $f_{\\text{drag}}(\\dot{x}) = -\\delta \\dot{x}$ and just to mix things up we also include a driving force of $f_{\\text{drive}}(t) = F\\cos(\\omega t)$. This leads to a total Newton's Second Law of:\n",

    "We begin with a parameter set of $F = 0.18$, $x(0) = -0.9$, and $y(0) = 0$. Here we plot $x(t)$ for $t\\in[0,2\\pi\\, 50]$ with  $t = n 2\\pi$ for $n = 0,1,\\ldots,50$. Then we do the same plot but as a two-dimensional parametric plot of x and y, this is known as a Poincare section of this parametric curve."
